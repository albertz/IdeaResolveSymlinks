# Problem / Situation

You click on some file which is a symlink
to some project files.
IntelliJ IDEA / PyCharm doesn't recognize this,
and opens the file as outside the project,
even in the case it is already opened.

There are a number of related bug reports,
such as:
[#12783](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-12783),
[#20544](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-20544),

This IDEA plugin resolves at least the open issues,
